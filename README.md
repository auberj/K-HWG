# K-HWG | Kate and Huw's Wedding Gift

Hey you, congratulations on your big day!

It was a bit of a challenge to think of a nerdy gift that wasn't crap so we made one!

Nathan left all of the design files and code on his work computer though so a description will have to suffice:
- 5x8 RGBW grid
- ESP32 MCU WiFi + BLE
- No battery, sorry, it wouoldn't last very long
- Front diffuser is sourced from Smile Plastics in Wales, is is made from reformed yogurt pot lids and CNC cut
- Rear plastic casing is 3D printed from recycled PLA from filamentive
- Boards from JLC PCB and then loveingly hand assembled

The firmware is just done in Arduino and the device follows the pin assignment of the Adafruit Feather Huzzah V2 - so easy to install the libraries etc.

Might be nice as a clock or something under the TV!
